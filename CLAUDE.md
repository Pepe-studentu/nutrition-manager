# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Kotlin Multiplatform Desktop application built with Compose Multiplatform. It's a nutrition/meal planning application that allows users to manage foods, meals, and multi-day menus with nutritional calculations.
The user is a nutrition professional who will use the app to speed up their workflow.

## Build and Development Commands

```bash
# Build the application
./gradlew build

# Run the desktop application
./gradlew composeApp:run

# Run tests
./gradlew test

# Clean build artifacts
./gradlew clean

# Create distribution packages
./gradlew packageDistributionForCurrentOS
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Structure
- **Model Layer**: Centralized state management using a singleton `Model` object with reactive Compose state
- **View Layer**: Compose UI components organized by screen functionality
- **Data Persistence**: JSON file-based storage for foods, meals, and multi-day menus

### Key Components

#### Model (`src/desktopMain/kotlin/org/example/project/model/`)
- `Model.kt` - Central singleton managing all application state and data operations
- `Food.kt` - Core food entity supporting both basic foods (with direct macros) and compound foods (composed of other foods)
- `FoodCategory.kt` - Enumeration of food categories (Dairy, Meat & Fish, Eggs, etc.)
- `FoodMacros.kt` - Data class for nutritional macro information (proteins, carbs, fats, water)
- `SizedFood.kt` - Bridge entity linking foods to meals with specific gram quantities
- `Meal.kt` - Meal entity composed of multiple sized foods with calculated nutritional totals
- `DailyMenu.kt` - Daily menu with 5 meal slots (breakfast, snack1, lunch, snack2, dinner)
- `MultiDayMenu.kt` - Multi-day menu plan containing multiple daily menus with average calculations
- `Screen.kt` - Navigation enumeration with icons (Foods, Menus)

#### View Layer (`src/desktopMain/kotlin/org/example/project/view/`)
- `App.kt` - Main application layout with navigation bar and content area
- `components/MyNavBar.kt` - Left sidebar navigation component
- `components/FoodTable.kt` - Reusable table component for food display
- `screens/FoodsScreen.kt` - Food management interface
- `screens/MenusScreen.kt` - Menu management interface
- `dialogs/FoodInputDialog.kt` - Dialog for adding/editing foods
- `dialogs/AddMealDialog.kt` - Dialog for creating meals
- `theme/Theme.kt` - Application theming

### Data Flow
1. Application loads data from JSON files on startup (foods.json, meals.json, multi_day_menus.json)
2. Model provides reactive state through Compose's mutableStateOf/mutableStateListOf
3. UI components observe Model state directly and trigger CRUD operations
4. All changes are immediately persisted to JSON files
5. Macro calculations are cached and computed recursively for compound foods

### Food System
- **Basic Foods**: Have direct macro values (proteins, carbs, fats, water percentage)
- **Compound Foods**: Composed of other foods with percentage-based composition
- **Usage Tracking**: Foods track usage count for referential integrity
- **Validation**: Ensures macro values are non-negative and don't exceed 100% total

### Navigation
Uses a simple enum-based navigation system with a sidebar. Screens include:
- Foods: Manage nutritional foods database (basic and compound foods)
- Menus: Create and manage multi-day menus with daily meal planning

## Development Notes

### State Management
The application uses a centralized Model singleton pattern rather than ViewModels or dependency injection. All state is managed reactively through Compose state primitives.

### Data Validation
- Nutritional values must be non-negative and sum to â‰¤100% for basic foods
- Compound food components must have positive percentages
- Referential integrity enforced (can't delete foods used in other foods/meals, meals used in menus)
- Input validation with proper error handling

### Macro Calculation
- Uses recursive calculation with caching for performance
- Compound foods calculate macros by aggregating component food macros
- Cache is cleared when foods are modified to ensure accuracy

### File Structure
- Main entry point: `Main.kt`
- All source code in `src/desktopMain/kotlin/org/example/project/`
- Resources in `src/desktopMain/composeResources/`
- JSON data files stored in `composeApp/` directory
