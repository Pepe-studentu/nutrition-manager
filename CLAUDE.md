# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Kotlin Multiplatform Desktop application built with Compose Multiplatform. It's a nutrition/meal planning application that allows users to manage ingredients, meals, and daily menus with nutritional calculations.
The user is a nutrition professional who will use the app to speed up his workflow.

## Build and Development Commands

```bash
# Build the application
./gradlew build

# Run the desktop application
./gradlew composeApp:run

# Run tests
./gradlew test

# Clean build artifacts
./gradlew clean

# Create distribution packages
./gradlew packageDistributionForCurrentOS
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Structure
- **Model Layer**: Centralized state management using a singleton `Model` object with reactive Compose state
- **View Layer**: Compose UI components organized by screen functionality
- **Data Persistence**: JSON file-based storage for ingredients, meals, and menus

### Key Components

#### Model (`src/desktopMain/kotlin/org/example/project/model/`)
- `Model.kt` - Central singleton managing all application state and data operations
- `Ingredient.kt`, `Meal.kt`, `DailyMenu.kt` - Data classes representing core entities
- `SizedIngredient.kt` - Bridge entity linking ingredients to meals with quantities
- `Screen.kt` - Navigation enumeration with icons

#### View Layer (`src/desktopMain/kotlin/org/example/project/view/`)
- `App.kt` - Main application layout with navigation bar and content area
- `MyNavBar.kt` - Left sidebar navigation component
- Screen-specific components: `IngredientsScreen.kt`, `MealScreen.kt`, `MenuScreen.kt`
- Dialog components: `AddMealDialog.kt`, `AddMenuDialog.kt`, `InsertDialog.kt`
- `IngredientTable.kt` - Reusable table component for ingredient display

### Data Flow
1. Application loads data from JSON files on startup (ingredients.json, meals.json, menus.json)
2. Model provides reactive state through Compose's mutableStateOf/mutableStateListOf
3. UI components observe Model state directly and trigger CRUD operations
4. All changes are immediately persisted to JSON files

### Navigation
Uses a simple enum-based navigation system with a sidebar. Screens include:
- Ingredients: Manage nutritional ingredients database
- Meals: Compose meals from ingredients with portions
- Menus: Create daily menus from meals
- MultiMenus: Placeholder for future functionality

## Development Notes

### State Management
The application uses a centralized Model singleton pattern rather than ViewModels or dependency injection. All state is managed reactively through Compose state primitives.

### Data Validation
- Nutritional values must be non-negative and sum to â‰¤100%
- Referential integrity enforced (can't delete ingredients used in meals, meals used in menus)
- Input validation with proper error handling

### File Structure
- Main entry point: `Main.kt`
- All source code in `src/desktopMain/kotlin/org/example/project/`
- Resources in `src/desktopMain/composeResources/`
- JSON data files stored at project root
